## Description
_This is my updated portfolio page. The base page was created a few weeks back and you can find that_ [here](https://amber-robeck.github.io/unitTwoPortfolio/ "Base Portfolio"). _This readMe has been created with the old readMe at the bottom for comparison. I added pictures of projects I have worked on and linked the deployed page as well as the repositories to those pages. I also added links to linkedIn and to my updated resume. Changed the Lorem text to a short about me section. Only minor css adjustments were made to the framework, font-sizes in the media-queries, and padding on some objects. I plan to further update this portfolio once my knowledge base grows futher, maybe even start a new one using bootstrap or bulma._

In all seriousness though, this is the beginning of what will be a beautiful portfolio page. I just started learning html, css and javascript. I am going to keep adding to this portfolio page (or maybe scrapping it and starting over would be the easier option.) üòÅ However it all plays out in the end there will be one thing that is certain now: this is the beginning of a beautifully-frustrating journey.
